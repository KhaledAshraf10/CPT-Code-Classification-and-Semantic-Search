# 🏷️ Medical Code Classification using NLP

## 📋 Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying medical CPT codes based on textual descriptions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It compares traditional ML pipelines with modern deep learning models to identify the most efficient solution.

The classification task is critical for medical billing and insurance workflows, where accuracy and semantic understanding are essential.
